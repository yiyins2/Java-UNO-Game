## This project 

Implement the game UNO. 

### The Model

Card class and its child classes define all the cards (its color and type) you need in the game. 

unogame.DrawPile and unogame.DiscardPile are helper classes that define setter, getter, and operation functions, including drawing cards and removing cards from the piles. 

unogame.Player class holds the hand of the player. 

unogame.Game class defines the effect of each card, initializes the game, and sets the game flow. 

### GUI

unogui included four views for the game: 
- start game view 
- game view
- choose color view
- winner view
